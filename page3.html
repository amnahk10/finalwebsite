    <h1> Ashland </h1>
        <p> Set at the foot of the Siskiyou Mountains, the city of Ashland began as Ashland Mills built on present-day Ashland Creek. 
        Being a small city, with only 20,000 people, there close to no tourism in Ashland. In the 1890s, Ashland became the region's cultural
        center by hosting the annual Chautauqua Festival. However, once the city of Medford surpassed Ashland, tourism began to falter again. 
        Lithia Park was created in 1914 and Lithia Springs hotel, now Ashland Springs Hotel, was built in the late 1920s. In 1935,after WWII, 
        Ashland started the Shakespeare festival. After building the Angus Bowmer Theater in 1970, tourism boomed. Ashland is now mainly a 
        tourism-feuled economy, and also known as one of the most diverse cities in America. </p>
